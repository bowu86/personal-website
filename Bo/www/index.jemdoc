== Short bio
Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [https://www.ae.utexas.edu/facultysites/topcu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Dr. Ufuk Topcu] in the Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES) at University of Texas at Austin. I successfully defended my Ph.D thesis directed by [https://www3.nd.edu/~hlin1/ Dr. Hai Lin] at the University of Notre Dame in April, 2018. My Ph.D thesis is about applying formal methods to the systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes which involves automata learning, unknown models and security issues. 


== Research
- My research interests span the areas of control theory, cyber-physical systems (CPS) and robotics. In particular, I am motivated by safety-critical applications requiring both security and performance guarantees. 
- My research applies ideas from machine learning, model checking and optimization to develop scalable formal methods framework to guarantee the correct behavior of such complex systems.
