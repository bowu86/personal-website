- One of the two major contributors. Designed the UAV interface structure. Modified the UAV firmware, added necessary communication modules and onboard computer such as Gumstix and Raspberry PI and sensors (Lidar, camera).
- Programed the UAV so that it can fly autonomously indoor with the help of the localization system and sense the environment to achieve higher autonomy.
- The whole framwork was written under ROS.
