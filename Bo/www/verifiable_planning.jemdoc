== Verifiable Planning under Uncertainty in Autonomous Systems
~~~
Reliably and efficiently satisfying the rich operating specifications in uncertain environments is a challenging design problem for autonomous systems with partial observability, non-linear, and non-deterministic dynamics.

This project is to build a unified counterexample-guided framework enabling autonomous systems with guaranteed performances in probabilistic temporal logic. The ideas are drawn from formal methods and planning.

Our results achieves efficient and reliable planning for probabilistic models such as Markov Decision Processes (MDP) or Partially Observable MDP (POMDP) subject to temporal logic specifications. With the learned permissive strategy, the autonomous systems may still be trusted despite partial loss of their capabilities without costly fault diagnosis and reconfiguration at run-time.

Cooperative multi-agent systems offer greater efficiency and flexibility due to the redundancy of functionalities, ability to re-configuration and robustness to uncertain environments with applications in power grids, transportation systems, computer networks to robotic teams.

This project is to establish formal design framework to automatically synthesize coordination and control schemes for cooperative multi-agent systems by considering temporal-logic specifications.

=== Formal methods based stability analysis of wireless networked control systems (WNCS)
~~~
{}{img_left}{pic\wncs.png}{alt text}{400}{300}
The stability of a WNCS is subjected to the uncertainties from unreliable communication. A formel method based approach is proposed to analyze the WNCS performance under imperfect wireless communication. This project built a communication and control codesign framework in which tradeoff has to be made between stability and communication parameter design.
