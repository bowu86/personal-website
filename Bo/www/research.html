<p>My research interests span the areas of control theory, cyber physical systems and robotics. In particular, I am motivated by learning based safety-critical applications requiring performance guarantees such as search and rescue with a team of robots. I am also interested in human robot interaction with performance guarantees such as manufacturing, semi-autonomous driving and self-driving. Current methods for the specification, design, and cyber physical systems are mostly trial-and-error processes which may lack of performance guarantee and could lead to unexpected failures. My research applies ideas from machine learning, model checking and optimization to develop scalable formal methods framework to guarantee the correct behavior of such complex systems.</p>

<td align="left"><p>A reliable and effective collaboration between human and machine has been recognized as being important or even necessary for many safety-critical systems, such as intelligent transportation and manufacturing automation. Achieving such a reliable and effective human-machine collaboration, however, is fairly challenging so far due to the complexities introduced by various types of system uncertainties that may arise from human operation, machine dynamics as well as dynamically changing environments and dynamic interactions between human.</p>
<p>This project it to build a unified formal design framework enabling a resilient human-machine collaboration with performance guarantee. The ideas are drawn from control theory, machine learning and human factor engineering.</p>
<p>Our preliminary results show that to achieve efficient and reliable collaboration, probabilistic models such as Markov Decision Processes (MDP) or Partially Observable MDP (POMDP) must be established which take human fatigue, trust and robot states into consideration. Temporal logic specifications must be enforced to guarantee desired system behavior and optimization needs to be performed for efficiency. </p>

<td align="left"><p>Cooperative multi-agent systems offer greater efficiency and flexibility due to the redundancy of functionalities, ability to re-configuration and robustness to uncertain environments with applications in power grids, transportation systems, computer networks to robotic teams.</p>
<p>This project is to establish formal design framework to automatically synthesize coordination and control schemes for cooperative multi-agent systems by combining a top-down mission planning with a bottom-up motion planning.</p>
<p>A compositional and learning based high level mission planning layer is proposed to decompose the global mission into local tasks. The motion planning for each robot is then solved by composing basic motion primitives that are verified safe by differential dynamic logic (d<img class="eq" src="eqs/6379065522976502591-130.png" alt="mathcal{L}" style="vertical-align: -1px" />). The motion primitive composition is through a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver that searches feasible solutions in face of constraints due to local task requirements and the environment description. </p>
<p>Our method can handle changing environments and on-line mission replanning. </p>
