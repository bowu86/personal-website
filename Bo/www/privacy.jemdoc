== Privacy in Autonomous Systems 
~~~
{}{img_left}{pic\privacy.png}{alt text}{300}{300}
- An autonomous system is often a complex system that integrates the symbolic decision-making and the control plants that directly interact with the physical world. 

- Such complexity also introduces vulnerabilities due to the tight coupling of symbolic decision-making and physical dynamics. 

- Consequently, such vulnerabilities pose significant challenges to networked systems that are safety-critical and may have a substantial social or economic impact if its privacy is compromised.
