<h1>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</h1>
<p>University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN</p>
<p>Research Assistant, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/nd.edu/discoverlab/">DISCOVER Lab</a>, August 2011 – present</p>
<p>Machine learning based planning 	2015 January - present</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Established a novel correct-by-design, machine learning based automated framework for probabilistic system planning</p>
</li>
<li><p>With applications in autonomous driving and human robot collaboration, resulting in multiple publications at IEEE top conferences and corresponding software written in C<tt></tt></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trust based human robot collaboration	2015 August – present</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Derived an optimal allocation strategy considering the uncertainties and dynamics in human trust, fatigue and robot performance with application in manufacturing systems. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Designed and developed the simulation in MATLAB and proved up to 50% improvement comparing to the existing approach. Resulting in one publication at IEEE top conference and the journal is in preparation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Automata based human robot collaboration robot demo development 	May - July, 2016 </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Designed and developed Baxter humanoid robot towel folding demo, utilized Robot Operating System (in Python and C<tt></tt>). </p>
</li>
<li><p>Responsible for prototyping, implementing, integrating and testing the sensing, object manipulation and planning classes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Drone development 	August 2013 – August 2014</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Major contributor in building the indoor autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) testbed</p>
</li>
<li><p>Designed the UAV interface structure, read through and modified the UAV firmware, programed the onboard computer (Raspberry Pi2) in C<tt></tt> with communication and task classes all under ROS</p>
</li>
<li><p>Achieved autonomous indoor flight and coordination with ground robots with position accuracy less than ±5 inches and delay less than 100 milliseconds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined task allocation and planning	 March 2015 – December 2015</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Developed a unified framework for autonomous integrated task and motion planning that can significantly reduce the planning complexity in exponential order. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Combined top-down task allocation and bottom-up safe motion primitives such that the coordination performance can be guaranteed even in dynamic environments, with possible application in automated warehouse, research resulted in two conference publications and one journal </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication and control co-design	 September 2013 – August 2014 </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Developed a novel approach such that communication protocol could adapt to networked control systems for better performance. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposed communication-control co-design framework. Performed simulation written in C<tt></tt> and the result is proven to be at least 10% more accurate than the existing approach. </p>
</li>
<li><p>The study revealed key insights in the tradeoff between system performance and the provided communication quality of service, resulting in two top conference publications and one journal (under review)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lund University	                                                                                                            Lund, Sweden</p>
