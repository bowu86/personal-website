- Towards a verified Artificial Intelligence

My research interests span the areas of control theory, cyber physical systems and robotics. In particular, I am motivated by learning based safety-critical applications requiring performance guarantees such as search and rescue with a team of robots. I am also interested in human robot interaction with performance guarantees such as manufacturing, semi-autonomous driving and self-driving. Current methods for the specification, design, and cyber physical systems are mostly trial-and-error processes which may lack of performance guarantee and could lead to unexpected failures. My research applies ideas from machine learning, model checking and optimization to develop scalable formal methods framework to guarantee the correct behavior of such complex systems.

- Human robust collaboration with performance guarantees

A reliable and effective collaboration between human and machine has been recognized as being important or even necessary for many safety-critical systems, such as intelligent transportation and manufacturing automation. Achieving such a reliable and effective human-machine collaboration, however, is fairly challenging due to the complexities introduced by various types of system uncertainties that may arise from human operation, machine dynamics as well as dynamically changing environments dynamic interactions between human, machine and external environments
- Combined top-down and bottom-up approaches for multi-robot system planning
- Learning based supervisory control of probabilistic multi-agent systems 
- Formal methods based stability analysis of wireless networked control systems
- Autonomous indoor fly of unmanned aerial vehicles
- Capacity improvement for cellular networks with multi-sector cooperation
