My research develops theories, algorithms, and tools necessary to answer the following central question to  realize the full spectrum of societal and industrial benefits of future autonomy “/how can we, in a data-rich world, efficiently design and operate autonomous systems that can be trusted?/”

Broadly speacking, the autonomous systems should

. provide *verifiable* performance in uncertain and dynamic environments,
. be *resilient* against corruption by  adversaries,
. keep sensitive data from different sources *private* during system design and operation, and
. be *proactive* in  achieving  the desired goal in a timely manner.
